Software is a set of instructions, data, or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. In the world of technology research, documentation of tools, applications, and software employed is fundamental to the completeness and reproducibility of any study. 
### OS scan, audit and hardening
This study entails installing and configuring tools for comprehensive operating system vulnerability assessments, entailing scanning, auditing, and hardening activities and will be in two (2) part. The 1st is OpenSCAP, CIS-CAT Lite Assessor, and Lynis installed on Ubuntu 20.04 workstation; the 2nd Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit and CIS-CAT Lite Assessor installed on Windows_10_Enterprise. System performance metrics (memory usage, disk I/O, and CPU load) will be tracked at stages (pre-scan, during scan, and post-scan) as security operation is conducted.

### Phase 1: OS Audit and Hardening tools installation on Ubuntu 20.04
#### [OpenSCAP](https://www.open-scap.org/) Installation 
The OpenSCAP will be installed using the 'Build and install from SOURCE method' as the traditional way of installation lacks important dependencies, workbench profiles, compliance security guide and dev environment. Below is the following steps for the installation procedure.
```bash
# OpenSCAP Installation Guide

## Update system and install basic tools

sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl wget git vim -y
```
```bash
## Install OpenSCAP dependencies

sudo apt install cmake build-essential pkg-config \
    libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libpcre3-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev \
    librpm-dev libbz2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libglib2.0-dev \
    libacl1-dev libselinux1-dev libdbus-1-dev libpopt-dev \
    python3-dev python3-pytest doxygen swig -y
```

## Clone and build OpenSCAP from source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/OpenSCAP/openscap.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd openscap

# Create and enter build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Generate build files with CMake
cmake ../

# Compile using all available CPU cores
make -j$(nproc)
```

## Install OpenSCAP
```bash
sudo make install
```

## Locate and create symlink for oscap binary
```bash
# Find where OpenSCAP was installed (system-wide)
sudo find /usr/local -name "oscap" -type f 2>/dev/null

# Find oscap binary in build directory
find ~/openscap/build -name "oscap" -type f 2>/dev/null

# Create symlink to make oscap available system-wide
sudo ln -s /home/$USER/openscap/build/utils/oscap /usr/local/bin/oscap

# Alternative: Add to PATH instead of creating symlink
# echo 'export PATH="$HOME/openscap/build/utils:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
# source ~/.bashrc
```

## Verify installation
```bash
oscap --version
```

## Additional setup (optional)
```bash
# Update library cache
sudo ldconfig

# Verify OpenSCAP can find its libraries
ldd /usr/local/bin/oscap
``` 
```
#### [CIS Compliance](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content) Benchmark and Security Guide installation for OpenSCAP
After installing OpenSCAP, also install its security profile from GitHub with:
```bash
gn@gn-VirtualBox:~$ # Install latest CIS benchmark and scap security guide compliance\
      wget https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/releases/download/0.1.76/scap-security-guide-0.1.76.zip \ 
      unzip scap-security-guide-0.1.76.zip \ 
      sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ \ 
      sudo cp scap-security-guide-0.1.76/*.xml  *.xml /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ \
      sudo ls -la /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content # Check what content is available \
      sudo find /usr/share -name "ubuntu" | grep -i scap #Check Ubuntu- content \
# Test Ubuntu content
gn@gn-VirtualBox:~$ sudo oscap info /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-ubuntu2004-ds.xml 2>/dev/null || echo   
gn@gn-VirtualBox:~$ # Check the security compliance guide installed
gn@gn-VirtualBox:~$ sudo oscap xccdf eval --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_standard
--results results.xml --report report.html /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-ubuntu2004-ds.xml 
```
#### [CIS-CAT Lite](https://learn.cisecurity.org/cis-cat-lite) Audit Installation 
CIS-CAT Lite is an audit tool incorporated with CIS benchmark and is useful for manual hardening.
```bash
#Install CIS-CAT dependency Java except jre/jdk 17
gn@gn-VirtualBox:~$ sudo apt install -y openjdk-11-jdk && sudo java ‚Äìversion 
gn@gn-VirtualBox:~$ mkdir -p ~/ciscat && cd ~/ciscat  # create and access cis-cat folder 
#Unzip and extract into the openscap build folder
gn@gn-VirtualBox:~/ciscat $ unzip ~/Downloads/'CIS-CAT Lite Assessor v4.55.0.zip' -d ~/openscap/build/ 
#Give execution permission and run
gn@gn-VirtualBox:~/openscap/build $ chmod +x ./Assessor-CLI.sh && ./Assessor-CLI.sh 
```
#### [Lynis](https://github.com/CISOfy/Lynis) Audit Installation
This is a deep scanning and audit tool that will be used to verify `True/False Positive or Negative`.
```bash
gn@gn-VirtualBox:~/openscap/build $ git clone https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis.git \
      sudo ln -s /opt/lynis/lynis /usr/local/bin/lynis \
      lynis --version #(Create symlink run from anywhere) 
# Test run a scan
gn@gn-VirtualBox:~/openscap/build $ sudo lynis audit system  
```
### Phase 2: OS Audit and Hardening tools installation on Windows_10_Enterprise
#### Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit 
Since the researcher is using a virtual machine, there isa  need to install a compatible scripting environment, hence installing the latest `PowerShell 7 Installation`
```powershell
# Navigate to the root of C: drive
Set-Location C:\

# Check Winget version (ensure it is installed)
winget --version

# Install the latest PowerShell 7 using Winget (requires Admin rights)
winget install --id Microsoft.Powershell --source winget
```
```powershell
# Quick all-in-one Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit (SCT) installer
function Install-CompleteSCT {
    $SCTPath = "C:\SecurityCompliance"
    New-Item -Path $SCTPath -ItemType Directory -Force

    Write-Host "üì• Downloading complete Microsoft SCT suite..." -ForegroundColor Cyan

    # All major SCT components
    $downloads = @{

        "Windows10-2004"   = "https://download.microsoft.com/download/8/5/C/85C25433-A1B0-4FFA-9429-7E023E7DA8D8/Windows%2010%20Version%202004%20and%20Windows%20Server%20Version%202004%20Security%20Baseline.zip"
        "PolicyAnalyzer"   = "https://download.microsoft.com/download/8/5/C/85C25433-A1B0-4FFA-9429-7E023E7DA8D8/PolicyAnalyzer.zip"
        "EdgeBaseline"     = "https://download.microsoft.com/download/8/5/C/85C25433-A1B0-4FFA-9429-7E023E7DA8D8/Microsoft%20Edge%20Security%20Baseline.zip"
    }

    foreach ($name in $downloads.Keys) {
        $url = $downloads[$name]
        $zipFile = "$SCTPath\$name.zip"
        $extractPath = "$SCTPath\$name"

        Write-Host "üîΩ Downloading $name..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
        Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $zipFile -UseBasicParsing

        Write-Host "üì¶ Extracting $name..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
        Expand-Archive -Path $zipFile -DestinationPath $extractPath -Force
        Remove-Item $zipFile -Force

        Write-Host "‚úÖ $name installed" -ForegroundColor Green
    }

    Write-Host "`nüéâ Complete SCT installation finished!" -ForegroundColor Green
    Write-Host "üìÅ Location: $SCTPath" -ForegroundColor Cyan

    Start-Process explorer.exe -ArgumentList $SCTPath
}

# Run complete installation
Install-CompleteSCT
```
```powershell
# Install OpenJDK 11 (required for running CIS-CAT Lite Assessor)
winget install --id Microsoft.OpenJDK.11 --source winget

# Refresh the environment variable for the current session
$env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "Machine") + ";" +
            [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User") Java -version
```

I've collected convenience functions that I've written to address issues I frequently confront in my work into a personal R package called [RWmisc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RWmisc). It includes functions for:

- Managing multiple different projections for cross-national spatial data
- Converting latitude-longitude data in archaic forms (degrees, minutes, seconds)
- Correcting for overlapping polygons when aggregating raster data to polygons
- My custom minimal ggplot2 theme

![](/images/software/spatial_weighting.png)

To install the latest release on CRAN:

```r
install.packages("RWmisc")
```

The latest [development version](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/RWmisc) on GitHub can be installed with:

```r
library(remotes)
install_github("jayrobwilliams/RWmisc")
```

# Other resources

I also have a number of other software resources focused on making computation and academic life easier:

- [The template](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/JobMarket) I use for my academic job market materials
    - Fill in school/position information in one file and it populates to all statements
    - Generate summary statistics from teaching evaluations and integrate into statements
    - Combine multiple teaching evaluations into a single portfolio document
    - Do all of this programmatically with GNU Make!
- [The template](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/UNC-Dissertation-Template) I used for my dissertation
    - This satisfied the formatting requirements at UNC in 2019
    - Some tweaking likely required to use at another institution or in the future
- [Scripts](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/Teaching) that I use to save time on various teaching-related tasks like grading
- [Functions](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/ComputerVision) for extracting still frames from videos and information from images in Python using OpenCV
- [Compiling OpenCV](/files/html/OpenCV_Install.html) from source for Anaconda virtual environments instead of Homebrew ones or system Python installations
