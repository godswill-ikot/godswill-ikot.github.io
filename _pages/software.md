In the world of technology research, documentation of tools, applications, and software employed is fundamental to the completeness and reproducibility of any study. 
## OS scan, audit and hardening
This study entails installing and configuring tools for comprehensive operating system vulnerability assessments, entailing scanning, auditing, and hardening activities. To understand the impact of these security operations, system performance metrics (memory usage, disk I/O, and CPU load) were tracked at different stages: pre-scan, during scan, and post-scan. Seeing the effort put into installation and ensuring consistent functionality, the subsequent sections give an account of their installation and operational procedures.

## OpenSCAP installation on Ubuntu 20.04 desktop

[[OpenSCAP](https://www.open-scap.org/)]

I am a developer of the [BayesPostEst](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BayesPostEst) R package for generating postestimation quantities of interest from Bayesian models. The package contains functions for producing regression tables, plotting predicted probabilities, calculating first differences, creating coefficient plots, and many other quantities. You can view the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/) article for the package [here](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01722).

To install the latest release on CRAN:

```bash
Step 1. Update and install all dependencies for web download

gn@gn-VirtualBox:~$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl  wget  git  vim –y 
gn@gn-VirtualBox:~$ # Install every OpenSCAP dependencies 
sudo apt install cmake build-essential pkg-config\ 
      libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libpcre3-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev\ 
      librpm-dev libbz2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libglib2.0-dev\ 
      libacl1-dev libselinux1-dev libdbus-1-dev libpopt-dev\ 
      python3-dev python3-pytest doxygen swig

gn@gn-VirtualBox:~$ # Extract and Install OpenSCAP using Git \ 
git clone https://github.com/OpenSCAP/openscap.git \ 
      cd openscap \ 
      mkdir build \ 
      cd build \ 
      cmake ../\  # generates build files 
      make -j$(nproc)  #  create the build directory and access it

gn@gn-VirtualBox:~$ sudo make install #install every package containing OpenSCAPE 
gn@gn-VirtualBox:~$ # Find where OpenSCAP was installed \ 
      ~/openscap/build$ sudo find /usr/local -name "oscap" -type f 2>/dev/null 

gn@gn-VirtualBox:~$ # Find directory \
      ~ /openscap/build$ find ~/openscap/build -name "oscap" -type f 2>/dev/null 
gn@gn-VirtualBox:~$ sudo ln -s /home/gn/openscap/build/utils/oscap /usr/local/bin/oscap #Create a sysmlink
gn@gn-VirtualBox:~$ Oscap –version  # Check version 
```

The latest [development version](https://github.com/ShanaScogin/BayesPostEst) on GitHub can be installed with:

```r
library(remotes)
install_github("ShanaScogin/BayesPostEst")
```

You can try out the `mcmcCoefPlot` function from the package in the interactive R console below:

[![CRAN_Status_Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/RWmisc)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RWmisc)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/jayrobwilliams/RWmisc/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/jayrobwilliams/RWmisc)

I've collected convenience functions that I've written to address issues I frequently confront in my work into a personal R package called [RWmisc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RWmisc). It includes functions for:

- Managing multiple different projections for cross-national spatial data
- Converting latitude-longitude data in archaic forms (degrees, minutes, seconds)
- Correcting for overlapping polygons when aggregating raster data to polygons
- My custom minimal ggplot2 theme

To install the latest release on CRAN:

```r
install.packages("RWmisc")
```

The latest [development version](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/RWmisc) on GitHub can be installed with:

```r
library(remotes)
install_github("jayrobwilliams/RWmisc")
```

# Other resources

I also have a number of other software resources focused on making computation and academic life easier:

- [The template](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/JobMarket) I use for my academic job market materials
    - Fill in school/position information in one file and it populates to all statements
    - Generate summary statistics from teaching evaluations and integrate into statements
    - Combine multiple teaching evaluations into a single portfolio document
    - Do all of this programmatically with GNU Make!
- [The template](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/UNC-Dissertation-Template) I used for my dissertation
    - This satisfied the formatting requirements at UNC in 2019
    - Some tweaking likely required to use at another institution or in the future
- [Scripts](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/Teaching) that I use to save time on various teaching-related tasks like grading
- [Functions](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/ComputerVision) for extracting still frames from videos and information from images in Python using OpenCV
- [Compiling OpenCV](/files/html/OpenCV_Install.html) from source for Anaconda virtual environments instead of Homebrew ones or system Python installations
