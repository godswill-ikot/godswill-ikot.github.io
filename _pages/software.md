Software is a set of instructions, data, or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. In the world of technology research, documentation of tools, applications, and software employed is fundamental to the completeness and reproducibility of any study. 
### OS scan, audit and hardening
This study entails installing and configuring tools for comprehensive operating system vulnerability assessments, entailing scanning, auditing, and hardening activities and will be in two (2) part. The 1st is OpenSCAP, CIS-CAT Lite Assessor, and Lynis installed on Ubuntu 20.04 workstation; the 2nd Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit and CIS-CAT Lite Assessor installed on Windows_10_Enterprise. System performance metrics (memory usage, disk I/O, and CPU load) will be tracked at stages (pre-scan, during scan, and post-scan) as security operation is conducted.

### Phase 1: OS Audit and Hardening tools installation on Ubuntu 20.04
#### [OpenSCAP](https://www.open-scap.org/) Installation 
The OpenSCAP will be installed using the 'Build and install from SOURCE method' as the traditional way of installation lacks important dependencies, workbench profiles, compliance security guide and dev environment. Below is the following steps for the installation procedure.
```bash
## Update system and install basic tools
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl wget git vim -y
## Install OpenSCAP dependencies
sudo apt install cmake build-essential pkg-config \
    libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libpcre3-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev \
    librpm-dev libbz2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libglib2.0-dev \
    libacl1-dev libselinux1-dev libdbus-1-dev libpopt-dev \
    python3-dev python3-pytest doxygen swig -y
```
```bash
# Clone and build OpenSCAP from the repository
git clone https://github.com/OpenSCAP/openscap.git
# Navigate to the project directory
cd openscap
# Create and enter build directory
mkdir build
cd build
# Generate build files with CMake
cmake ../
# Compile using all available CPU cores
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install # Install Openscap
```
#### Locate and create symlink for oscap binary
```bash
# Find where OpenSCAP was installed (system-wide)
sudo find /usr/local -name "oscap" -type f 2>/dev/null
# Find oscap binary in build directory
find ~/openscap/build -name "oscap" -type f 2>/dev/null
# Create symlink to make oscap available system-wide
sudo ln -s /home/$USER/openscap/build/utils/oscap /usr/local/bin/oscap
oscap --version # Verify installation
```
#### [CIS Compliance](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content) Benchmark and Security Guide installation for OpenSCAP
After installing OpenSCAP, also install its security profile from GitHub with:
```bash
# Download the latest SCAP Security Guide
wget https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/releases/download/v0.1.76/scap-security-guide-0.1.76.zip
# Extract the archive
unzip scap-security-guide-0.1.76.zip
# Create directory for SCAP content
sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/
# Copy SCAP content files to system directory
cd scap-security-guide-0.1.76
sudo cp *.xml /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/
# Verify content installation
sudo ls -la /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/
# Find Ubuntu-specific SCAP content
sudo find /usr/share -name "*ubuntu*" | grep -i scap

# Test Ubuntu 20.04 content availability
sudo oscap info /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-ubuntu2004-ds.xml 2>/dev/null || echo "Ubuntu 20.04 
# List all available DataStream files
ls -la /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-*-ds.xml
```
```bash
# Run SCAP evaluation with standard profile for Ubuntu 20.04
sudo oscap xccdf eval \
    --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_standard \
    --results results.xml \
    --report report.html \
    /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-ubuntu2004-ds.xml
# Alternative: Run evaluation for Ubuntu 22.04 (or choose your version if available)
# sudo oscap xccdf eval \
#     --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_standard \
#     --results results-ubuntu2204.xml \
#     --report report-ubuntu2204.html \
#     /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-ubuntu2204-ds.xml
# Show all available profiles for Ubuntu 20.04
sudo oscap info /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-ubuntu2004-ds.xml | grep -A 50 "Profiles:"
```
#### Additional useful commands
```bash
# Generate remediation script
sudo oscap xccdf generate fix \
    --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_standard \
    --output remediation-script.sh \
    /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-ubuntu2004-ds.xml
# Check for specific compliance frameworks
sudo oscap info /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-ubuntu2004-ds.xml | grep -i "cis\|nist\|pci"
# To view HTML report use: firefox report.html or your preferred browser
```
```bash
# Troubleshoot: If content files are missing, check what was actually extracted
ls -la scap-security-guide-0.1.76/
# Verify oscap can access the files
sudo oscap --version
# Check file permissions
ls -la /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/
# If evaluation fails, run with verbose output
sudo oscap xccdf eval \
    --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_standard \
    --results results.xml \
    --report report.html \
    --verbose INFO \
    /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-ubuntu2204-ds.xml
```
#### [CIS-CAT Lite](https://learn.cisecurity.org/cis-cat-lite) Audit Installation 
CIS-CAT Lite is an audit tool incorporated with CIS benchmark and is useful for manual hardening.
```bash
# CIS-CAT Lite Installation and Setup
sudo apt install -y openjdk-11-jdk # Install Java (CIS-CAT dependency) OpenJDK 11
java --version # Verify Java installation
echo $JAVA_HOME # Check Java environment
which java
```
#### Set up CIS-CAT directory structure
```bash
# Create CIS-CAT working directory
mkdir -p ~/ciscat
cd ~/ciscat
# Extract to openscap build folder if preferred
unzip ~/Downloads/'CIS-CAT Lite Assessor v4.55.0.zip' -d ~/openscap/build/

# Navigate to extracted CIS-CAT directory
cd ~/ciscat/Assessor-CLI/
chmod +x ./Assessor-CLI.sh # Make the assessor executable
./Assessor-CLI.sh # Run CIS-CAT with basic options
# Run with HTML report output
./Assessor-CLI.sh -b benchmarks/CIS_Ubuntu_Linux_20.04_LTS_Benchmark_v1.1.0-xccdf.xml -r ~/ciscat/reports/
```
#### Troubleshooting
```bash
# If Java version issues occur
java --version
# Check if CIS-CAT files are properly extracted
find ~/ciscat -name "*.sh" -type f
# If permission denied errors
chmod -R +x ~/ciscat/Assessor-CLI/
```
#### [Lynis](https://github.com/CISOfy/Lynis) Audit Installation
This is a deep scanning and audit tool that will be used to verify `True/False Positive or Negative`.
```bash
sudo git clone https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis.git # Clone the Lynis repository
# Create a symlink to run Lynis from anywhere
sudo ln -s /opt/lynis/lynis /usr/local/bin/lynis
lynis --version # Verify installation
sudo lynis audit system # Test run system audit
```
## Phase 2: OS Audit and Hardening tools installation on Windows_10_Enterprise
### Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit 
Since the researcher is using a virtual machine, there isa  need to install a compatible scripting environment, hence installing the latest `PowerShell 7 Installation`
```powershell
# Navigate to the root of C: drive
Set-Location C:\
# Check Winget version (ensure it is installed)
winget --version
# Install the latest PowerShell 7 using Winget (requires Admin rights)
winget install --id Microsoft.Powershell --source winget
```
```powershell
# Quick all-in-one Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit (SCT) installer
function Install-CompleteSCT {
    $SCTPath = "C:\SecurityCompliance"
    New-Item -Path $SCTPath -ItemType Directory -Force

    Write-Host "üì• Downloading complete Microsoft SCT suite..." -ForegroundColor Cyan

    # All major SCT components

    }

    foreach ($name in $downloads.Keys) {
        $url = $downloads[$name]
        $zipFile = "$SCTPath\$name.zip"
        $extractPath = "$SCTPath\$name"

        Write-Host "üîΩ Downloading $name..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
        Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $zipFile -UseBasicParsing

        Write-Host "üì¶ Extracting $name..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
        Expand-Archive -Path $zipFile -DestinationPath $extractPath -Force
        Remove-Item $zipFile -Force

        Write-Host "‚úÖ $name installed" -ForegroundColor Green
    }

    Write-Host "`nüéâ Complete SCT installation finished!" -ForegroundColor Green
    Write-Host "üìÅ Location: $SCTPath" -ForegroundColor Cyan

    Start-Process explorer.exe -ArgumentList $SCTPath
}

# Run complete installation
Install-CompleteSCT
```
```powershell
# Install OpenJDK 11 (required for running CIS-CAT Lite Assessor)
winget install --id Microsoft.OpenJDK.11 --source winget
# Refresh the environment variable for the current session
$env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "Machine") + ";" +
            [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User") Java -version
```

I've collected convenience functions that I've written to address issues I frequently confront in my work into a personal R package called [RWmisc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RWmisc). It includes functions for:

- Managing multiple different projections for cross-national spatial data
- Converting latitude-longitude data in archaic forms (degrees, minutes, seconds)
- Correcting for overlapping polygons when aggregating raster data to polygons
- My custom minimal ggplot2 theme

![](/images/software/spatial_weighting.png)

To install the latest release on CRAN:

```r
install.packages("RWmisc")
```

The latest [development version](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/RWmisc) on GitHub can be installed with:

```r
library(remotes)
install_github("jayrobwilliams/RWmisc")
```

# Other resources

I also have a number of other software resources focused on making computation and academic life easier:

- [The template](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/JobMarket) I use for my academic job market materials
    - Fill in school/position information in one file and it populates to all statements
    - Generate summary statistics from teaching evaluations and integrate into statements
    - Combine multiple teaching evaluations into a single portfolio document
    - Do all of this programmatically with GNU Make!
- [The template](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/UNC-Dissertation-Template) I used for my dissertation
    - This satisfied the formatting requirements at UNC in 2019
    - Some tweaking likely required to use at another institution or in the future
- [Scripts](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/Teaching) that I use to save time on various teaching-related tasks like grading
- [Functions](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/ComputerVision) for extracting still frames from videos and information from images in Python using OpenCV
- [Compiling OpenCV](/files/html/OpenCV_Install.html) from source for Anaconda virtual environments instead of Homebrew ones or system Python installations
