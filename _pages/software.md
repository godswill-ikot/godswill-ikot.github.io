Software is a set of instructions, data, or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. In the world of technology research, documentation of tools, applications, and software employed is fundamental to the completeness and reproducibility of any study. 
### OS scan, audit and hardening
This study entails installing and configuring tools for comprehensive operating system vulnerability assessments, entailing scanning, auditing, and hardening activities. The OpenSCAP, CIS-CAT Lite Assessor, and Lynis will be installed on an Ubuntu 20.04 workstation; the Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit and CIS-CAT Lite Assessor will also be installed on Windows 10 Enterprise. System performance metrics (memory usage, disk I/O, and CPU load) will be tracked at stages(pre-scan, during scan, and post-scan) as security operation is conducted.

### OpenSCAP installation on Ubuntu 20.04 desktop `[[OpenSCAP](https://www.open-scap.org/)]`

The OpenSCAP will be installed using the 'Build and install from SOURCE method' as the traditional way of installation lacks important dependencies, workbench profiles, compliance security guide and dev environment. Below is the following steps for the installation procedure.

```bash
gn@gn-VirtualBox:~$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl  wget  git  vim –y 
gn@gn-VirtualBox:~$ # Install every OpenSCAP dependency 
sudo apt install cmake build-essential pkg-config\ 
      libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libpcre3-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev\ 
      librpm-dev libbz2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libglib2.0-dev\ 
      libacl1-dev libselinux1-dev libdbus-1-dev libpopt-dev\ 
      python3-dev python3-pytest doxygen swig

gn@gn-VirtualBox:~$ # Extract and Install OpenSCAP using Git \ 
git clone https://github.com/OpenSCAP/openscap.git \ 
      cd openscap \ 
      mkdir build \ 
      cd build \ 
      cmake ../\  # generates build files 
      make -j$(nproc)  #  create the build directory and access it

gn@gn-VirtualBox:~$ sudo make install #install every package containing OpenSCAPE 
gn@gn-VirtualBox:~$ # Find where OpenSCAP was installed \ 
      ~/openscap/build$ sudo find /usr/local -name "oscap" -type f 2>/dev/null 

gn@gn-VirtualBox:~$ # Find directory \
      ~ /openscap/build$ find ~/openscap/build -name "oscap" -type f 2>/dev/null 
gn@gn-VirtualBox:~$ sudo ln -s /home/gn/openscap/build/utils/oscap /usr/local/bin/oscap #Create a sysmlink
gn@gn-VirtualBox:~$ Oscap –version  # Check version 
```

### CIS Benchmark and Security Compliance installation 
`[CIS Compliance]`([https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content]) on GitHub can be installed with:

```bash
gn@gn-VirtualBox:~$ # Install latest CIS benchmark and scape security guide compliance\
      wget https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/releases/download/0.1.76/scap-security-guide-0.1.76.zip \ 
      unzip scap-security-guide-0.1.76.zip \ 
      sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ \ 
      sudo cp scap-security-guide-0.1.76/*.xml  *.xml /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ \
      sudo ls -la /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content # Check what content is available \
      sudo find /usr/share -name "ubuntu" | grep -i scap #Check Ubuntu- content \

gn@gn-VirtualBox:~$ sudo oscap info /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-ubuntu2004-ds.xml 2>/dev/null || echo  # Test Ubuntu content 

gn@gn-VirtualBox:~$ sudo oscap xccdf eval --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_standard
--results results.xml --report report.html /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-ubuntu2004-ds.xml 

```

You can try out the `mcmcCoefPlot` function from the package in the interactive R console below:

I've collected convenience functions that I've written to address issues I frequently confront in my work into a personal R package called [RWmisc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RWmisc). It includes functions for:

- Managing multiple different projections for cross-national spatial data
- Converting latitude-longitude data in archaic forms (degrees, minutes, seconds)
- Correcting for overlapping polygons when aggregating raster data to polygons
- My custom minimal ggplot2 theme

To install the latest release on CRAN:

```r
install.packages("RWmisc")
```

The latest [development version](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/RWmisc) on GitHub can be installed with:

```r
library(remotes)
install_github("jayrobwilliams/RWmisc")
```

# Other resources

I also have a number of other software resources focused on making computation and academic life easier:

- [The template](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/JobMarket) I use for my academic job market materials
    - Fill in school/position information in one file and it populates to all statements
    - Generate summary statistics from teaching evaluations and integrate into statements
    - Combine multiple teaching evaluations into a single portfolio document
    - Do all of this programmatically with GNU Make!
- [The template](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/UNC-Dissertation-Template) I used for my dissertation
    - This satisfied the formatting requirements at UNC in 2019
    - Some tweaking likely required to use at another institution or in the future
- [Scripts](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/Teaching) that I use to save time on various teaching-related tasks like grading
- [Functions](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/ComputerVision) for extracting still frames from videos and information from images in Python using OpenCV
- [Compiling OpenCV](/files/html/OpenCV_Install.html) from source for Anaconda virtual environments instead of Homebrew ones or system Python installations
