Welcome! I am a passionate and dedicated cybersecurity professional who constantly learns and applies security best practices, principles, and frameworks in securing assets. With a strong foundation in information security principles and risk management frameworks such as ISO 27001, COBIT, GDPR, ITIL and HIPPA for protecting critical data and systems, I am eager to contribute to building safer and more resilient digital environments.

My expertise lies in building frameworks with the organisations' available resources in compliance with industry standards to help identify vulnerabilities, mitigate risks, and implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data in ever-evolving threat landscapes. 
With hands-on and lab experience in network security, threat analysis, and incident response, I thrive in environments that demand critical thinking and quick decision-making. I am proficient in leveraging tools like SIEM systems, firewalls, Wireshark, Nessus, and Metasploit to identify and mitigate potential threats and vulnerability scanners, alongside scripting languages such as Python and Bash, to detect and neutralize security threats effectively and I am also proficient in the use of Mysql for database query. 

I earned my MSc in Cybersecurity from the
[University *of* Roehampton London]([https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/]) and my
B.Tech in Statics from [Federal University *of* Technology Akure]([https://www.futa.edu.ng/])

In addition to my academic certifications I also hold certifications such as [e.g., Google Cybersecurity Certificate, CompTIA Security+], which validate my technical skills and commitment to continuous learning. 
My goal is to stay ahead of cyber adversaries by researching emerging technologies, analyzing attack patterns, and fostering a proactive security culture within organizations.

Beyond my technical expertise, I excel in *Teaching* security with cross-functional teams, delivering comprehensive security awareness training, and translating complex cybersecurity concepts into actionable strategies for stakeholders. Whether defending critical infrastructure or enhancing incident response plans, I am dedicated to making the digital world a safer place.

In my free time, I enjoy participating in capture-the-flag (CTF) competitions, exploring the latest cybersecurity trends, and mentoring aspiring professionals in the field. I believe that a strong defense starts with a knowledgeable and vigilant team, and I am always eager to contribute my skills and expertise to drive success in cybersecurity initiatives.
